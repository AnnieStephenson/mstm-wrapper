This package provides a python wrapper around
the [MSTM fortran-90 code](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~dmckwski/scatcodes/)
written by Daniel Mackowski. It produces input files, sends them to the mstm
executable, parses the output files, and calculates quantities of interest for
static light scattering measurements. The mstm executable should be located in
the user's path.
